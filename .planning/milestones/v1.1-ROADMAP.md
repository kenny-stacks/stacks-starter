# Milestone v1.1: Hiro Platform Migration

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 6
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Remove Hiro Platform hosted devnet dependency and make local Clarinet devnet the only development path. This simplifies developer onboarding by eliminating external account requirements and API key configuration.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Hiro Platform Removal

**Goal**: Local Clarinet devnet is the only development path (Hiro Platform configuration removed)
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (v1 shipped)
**Requirements**: CODE-01, CODE-02, CODE-03, CODE-04, DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

**Success Criteria:**
1. Devnet configuration only references localhost:3999 (no Hiro Platform URLs)
2. Environment variables contain no platform-specific keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HIRO_API_KEY removed)
3. README shows local devnet setup with `clarinet devnet start` (no platform references)
4. All documentation guides reflect local-only Clarinet workflow

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Remove Hiro Platform configuration from code and environment files
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Update all documentation for local Clarinet devnet workflow

**Commits:**
- d593f7f — refactor(06-01): simplify devnet.ts to localhost-only
- 906128e — refactor(06-01): clean environment files
- 01a53c5 — docs(06-02): update README with local devnet workflow
- 219e9fc — docs(06-02): rewrite getting-started.md for local devnet
- d9d4e27 — docs(06-02): update extending.md deployment references

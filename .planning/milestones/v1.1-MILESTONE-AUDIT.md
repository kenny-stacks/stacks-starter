**Audited:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All v1.1 requirements satisfied. Phase 6 verification passed. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete. No critical gaps or tech debt.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| CODE-01 | Remove Hiro Platform API constants from devnet.ts | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| CODE-02 | Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_HOST conditional logic | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| CODE-03 | Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HIRO_API_KEY usage | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| CODE-04 | Simplify devnet configuration to localhost:3999 | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| DOCS-01 | Update README with local devnet setup | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| DOCS-02 | Rewrite getting-started.md for Clarinet workflow | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| DOCS-03 | Update extending.md deployment references | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |
| DOCS-04 | Update .env.example to remove platform variables | 6 | ✅ Satisfied |

**Coverage:** 8/8 (100%)

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verification Status | Blockers |
|-------|------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| 6 | Hiro Platform Removal | 2/2 | ✅ PASSED | None |

**Phase 6 Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ Devnet configuration only references localhost:3999
2. ✅ Environment variables contain no platform-specific keys
3. ✅ README shows local devnet setup with `clarinet devnet start`
4. ✅ All documentation guides reflect local-only Clarinet workflow

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Export | Source | Consumer | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| `DEVNET_STACKS_BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL` | devnet.ts | stacks-api.ts | ✅ Connected |
| `DEVNET_NETWORK` | devnet.ts | contract-utils.ts | ✅ Connected |
| `devnetWallets` | devnet-wallet-context.ts | contracts.ts | ✅ Connected |
| Documentation links | README.md | docs/*.md | ✅ Valid |
| Deployment plan | default.devnet-plan.yaml | contracts.ts | ✅ Aligned |

**Integration Score:** 5/5 connections verified

## E2E Flows Verified

### Flow 1: Developer Setup
Clone → Install → Copy .env → Start devnet → Start dev server → Open app
**Status:** ✅ Complete (no platform dependencies)

### Flow 2: Counter Interaction
Click Increment → Hook mutation → Contract call → Devnet broadcast → Cache invalidate → UI update
**Status:** ✅ Complete (uses localhost:3999)

### Flow 3: Wallet Connection (Devnet)
Detect devnet → Show wallet selector → Select wallet → Set context → Enable buttons
**Status:** ✅ Complete (auto-signing works)

### Flow 4: Contract Deployment
clarinet devnet start → Deploy counter.clar → Front-end reads correct address
**Status:** ✅ Complete (deployer address matches)

**Flow Score:** 4/4 flows verified

## Impact Summary

### What Changed
- `front-end/src/constants/devnet.ts` simplified from conditional to hardcoded
- `front-end/.env.example` reduced from 5 to 3 variables
- README, getting-started.md, extending.md updated for local workflow

### What Was Removed
- `PLATFORM_API_DOMAIN` constant
- `DEVNET_STACKS_BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL_PLATFORM` constant
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_HOST` environment variable
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HIRO_API_KEY` environment variable
- All Hiro Platform account/API key documentation

### Developer Experience
- **Before:** Platform account required, API key configuration, external dependency
- **After:** Docker + `clarinet devnet start` only

## Tech Debt

None. Phase 6 was a pure simplification with no shortcuts or deferred items.

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.1 achieved its definition of done:**
- All 8 requirements satisfied
- Phase 6 verification passed with 9/9 observable truths
- Cross-phase integration verified (5/5 connections)
- E2E flows complete (4/4 flows)
- No blockers, gaps, or tech debt

**Ready for:** `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.1`

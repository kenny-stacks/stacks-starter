<objective>
Create README.md and docs/getting-started.md - the entry point documentation for the starter kit.

Purpose: Developers clone the repo and need immediate clarity on what this is, how to run it, and where to learn more. README is the 5-minute overview; getting-started.md is the detailed tutorial.

Output: Rewritten README.md and new docs/getting-started.md
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the current fundraising README with a minimal starter kit README following these decisions from CONTEXT.md:

**Structure (in this order):**
1. Project title: "Stacks Starter" with one-line description
2. Prerequisites section:
   - Node.js 18+ (link to nodejs.org)
   - pnpm (link to pnpm.io/installation)
   - Clarinet (link to docs.hiro.so/clarinet)
   - Knowledge: React, TypeScript, Stacks basics (link to docs.stacks.co)
3. Quick Start section:
   - pnpm install
   - Copy .env.example, set NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HIRO_API_KEY
   - pnpm --filter front-end dev
   - Open localhost:3000
   - Link to docs/getting-started.md for detailed walkthrough
4. Project Structure section:
   - Brief tree showing clarity/ and front-end/ top-level
   - One-line description of each major folder
5. Documentation links section:
   - Link to docs/getting-started.md (setup tutorial)
   - Link to docs/patterns.md (architecture patterns)
   - Link to docs/extending.md (replace counter with your contract)

**Constraints from CONTEXT.md:**
- No screenshot or GIF (delete the existing screenshot reference)
- No badges
- Minimal length - link to docs/ for details
- Concise/technical tone

**Delete:**
- All fundraising-specific content
- The customization section
- The smart contract details section
- Testing with Devnet section (this moves to getting-started.md)
- Next Steps section (testnet/mainnet details move to extending.md)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. File exists and is under 100 lines
2. Contains "Quick Start" heading
3. Contains links to all 3 docs files
4. No mention of "fundraising" or old content
5. No screenshot reference
  </verify>
  <done>README is minimal (under 100 lines), contains quick start with prerequisites, project structure overview, and links to docs/getting-started.md, docs/patterns.md, docs/extending.md</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create docs/getting-started.md</name>
  <files>docs/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
Create a detailed setup walkthrough following the task-based pattern from RESEARCH.md:

**Structure:**

## Prerequisites (can I start?)
- Node.js 18+ with link
- pnpm with link and install command
- Clarinet with link
- Hiro Platform account with link to platform.hiro.so
- Basic React/TypeScript knowledge with link to learning resources

## Installation (get it running)
Step-by-step with code blocks:
1. Clone the repo
2. pnpm install
3. Copy front-end/.env.example to front-end/.env
4. Get Hiro Platform API key (explain where: platform.hiro.so/settings/api-keys)
5. Add API key to .env file
6. Start Devnet in Hiro Platform
7. pnpm --filter front-end dev
8. Open localhost:3000

## Verify It Works (prove it works)
1. Counter should display "0"
2. Click Increment, watch pending state
3. Counter updates to "1"
4. Click Decrement, watch it return to "0"

Brief explanation: "What just happened" - browser called Clarity contract, React Query refetched, UI updated.

## Understanding the Flow (mental model)
Brief overview linking to patterns.md:
- Wallet connection (devnet auto-sign vs Leather)
- Contract reads (useCounterValue query)
- Contract writes (useIncrementCounter mutation)
- "See docs/patterns.md for detailed architecture"

## Making a Change (confidence builder)
Simple exercise:
1. Open clarity/contracts/counter.clar
2. Change increment amount from u1 to u5
3. Restart Devnet (explain why: contract changes need redeploy)
4. Test increment - now adds 5

## Troubleshooting
3-5 common issues:
- "Contract not found" - Devnet not started or not deployed
- "Transaction failed" - Check network matches wallet
- "API key error" - Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HIRO_API_KEY is set
- Counter shows error state - Is Devnet running? Check Hiro Platform dashboard

**Link to source files, don't inline code** (CONTEXT.md decision):
- For wallet setup, link to front-end/src/components/providers/wallet-provider.tsx
- For counter queries, link to front-end/src/hooks/counterQueries.ts
  </action>
  <verify>
1. File exists at docs/getting-started.md
2. Contains "Prerequisites", "Installation", "Verify It Works" sections
3. Contains "Troubleshooting" section
4. Links to source files rather than inlining code
5. Links to docs/patterns.md for deeper architecture
  </verify>
  <done>getting-started.md exists with prerequisites checklist, installation steps, verification instructions, mental model overview, simple exercise, and troubleshooting section</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. README.md is concise and links to all 3 docs files
2. docs/getting-started.md provides complete setup walkthrough
3. A new developer could follow getting-started.md from clone to working counter
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README under 100 lines with quick start and project structure
- getting-started.md covers: prerequisites, installation, verification, mental model, exercise, troubleshooting
- Both files link to source code rather than inline snippets
- No fundraising content remains
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation-polish/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
